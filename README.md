# Personal Dictionary Mobile App

The **Personal Dictionary Mobile App** is designed to help users build and manage their own personalized dictionary for language learning. This app provides a seamless experience for users to collect and review words while offering various tools to enhance learning, such as web sources and dictionary features. The app is built using **React Native** and **AWS Amplify**, ensuring a smooth and scalable experience across different mobile platforms.

## Features

### 1. **Personal Dictionary**
The core feature of the app is the **Personal Dictionary**, where users can add and organize their vocabulary. Words that are added can be marked as "learned" and users can review their progress. Each word can be further explored with the following options:
- Listen to the pronunciation
- View detailed information (definitions, translations, and more)
- Watch videos related to the word

### 2. **Web Sources**
The **Web Sources** feature gives users access to curated, language-learning websites directly within the app. From here, users can explore new words by clicking on words of interest. Upon clicking a word, users are given the option to:
- Add the word to their personal dictionary
- View detailed information about the word  
This feature makes it easy for users to build their vocabulary while exploring the web.

## Technology

- **React Native**: A framework for building cross-platform mobile apps with native performance.
- **AWS Amplify**: A powerful cloud service that integrates authentication, database management, and real-time capabilities for a seamless user experience.

## Relationship with Other Platforms

This mobile app is connected with other parts of the project, such as the **Web Extension** and **Website**. Words added to the personal dictionary through the mobile app are synced with the **Website**, so users can access their vocabulary on any platform. Likewise, words saved using the **Web Extension** will appear in the mobile appâ€™s dictionary, providing a seamless learning experience across different devices.
